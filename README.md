# scala3_for_gitpod
This project provides the GitPod development environment with SBT and 
Scala 3 syntax highlighting. The setup only need the two files
* .gitpod.yml
* Dockerfile

## On GitPod
Please read the terms and conditions of GitPod to understand what the concrete offer is.
In this section I shall describe shortly the feature that I find at the moment most 
fascinating and useful to me.

GitPod is a browser based development enviroment and should (hopefully) work in any browser
independent of the OS the browser is run on. So for example, one should be able to code on 
a Chromebook or IPad. It works by giving GitPod the address to a/your Git repo at one of the
larger Git hosts such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket (see further down). It will start the
development environment in the cloud whose GUI will then be displayed in your browser tab.

Currently, GitPod lets you use the service for 50h a month free, if you are 
developing in a public Git repository! Public does not mean that anyone can delete or overwrite
your code! I only means that it can be viewed and inspected by anyone. Also, for someone who just 
wants to try things out or maybe learn Scala 50h per month should be enough: If you work on your 
project every weekday of a month you have two hours per day. Enough for a side project, me thinks. 
If you pay, you get obviously more. :)

## How to Start the Environment
You can try it out with this environment.
